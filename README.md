## 📦 What’s Inside?
A growing toolbox of quirky, useful, and sometimes overengineered utilities for life, learning, and coding. From simple calculators to logic-infused code tools.

| 🔧 Tool Name        | 💡 Description                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 `ai-time-calc`    | Calculate how much time you're *actually* spending training AI models (with breaks 😅) |
| 💰 `crypto-convert`  | Turn BTC into USD (or your hopes into decimals) |
| 📆 `date-fixer`      | Auto-fixes your messed up date formats from user input |
| 🍔 `calorie-counter` | Keep track of your fuel — even if it's mostly coffee |
| 🎮 `game-timer`      | Counts how many hours you've spent *"just 5 more minutes"* |
